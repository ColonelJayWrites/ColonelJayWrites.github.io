    	<h1>Shingeki no Kyojin — Hajime Isayama's Magnum Opus</h1>
    	<hr />

    	<div>
    		<p>Shingeki no Kyojin (SnK), or Attack on Titan (AoT), begins with a dramatic thrust into violence. We are introduced to the Titans — huge, monstrous humanoids who ravage on human flesh, for what we can only assume to be "amusement". The remnants of humanity gather behind three, concentric walls, built 50 metres high, to impede the titan invasion. For a century, those walls stood resolute, but that fragile peace was shattered when a Colossal Titan — reportedly 60 metres tall — breaks the outer wall gate, reigniting the terror that dawned humanity.</p>
    		<p>Upon the horrific loss of his mother by the hands of a Smiling Titan, Eren Yaeger dedicates his heart to the eradication of these Titans. Eren, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert enlist in the Survey Corps, an elite military brigade that conducts reconaissance and combat against the Titans, outside the relative safety of the walls.</p>
    		<p>Together, they must find a way to defeat them, lest even the last wall falls apart.</p>
    	</div>

    	<div id='animation'>
    		<h2>Animation</h2>

    		<div>
	    		<p>SnK is best known for its stunning visuals, bold art style, and spell-binding animation. Let's tackle all three, shall we?</p>
	    	</div>

	    	<div>
	    		<ul>
	    			<li><b>Visuals</b></li>
		    			<p>SnK has always had amazing background artists, able to transform even the most minor of comic panels into a beautiful view. The series' focus on foliage and the natural scenery aids in highlighting the contrast between the various soldiers and the Titans. The sunlight ensures there is enough brightness to get a full, clear shot, and you'd be hard-pressed to miss a significant detail.</p>

		    			<div class='standard-img'>
		    				<img class='si-1' src="https://preview.redd.it/on7ysn6wlrj61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d772c603cce539fc2d29cc9ad67bde1e4235b3b6" alt="Wooden planks overgrown with flora, grass tusling with leaves." />
		    				<img class='si-1' src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/72/44/ac/7244ac665c8d95f1d67cae3e198ea70e.jpg' alt="Clouds of Shiganshina, moments before the Colossal Titan's appearance." />
		    				<img class='si-1' src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/06/4f/dd/064fddff8c973dc62a8535f4d306aeb8.jpg" alt="Grasslands, as the sun sets. A small hut sits to the side of a winding road." />
		    				<img class='si-1' src="https://preview.redd.it/bbfce13wlrj61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0851774d7bb4fb0e0ada56f20d042be8a78e8aab" alt='Two Eldian conscripts by a lake, lost in the woods.' />
		    				<img class='si-1' src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/57/d0/1a/57d01ad0f1c0192d3283f5231cc6ec8c.jpg" alt='The 104th Cadet Corps, donning a cape with the insignia: "Wings of Freedom".' />
		    			</div>

		    			<p>The quality of the shot ties in with the cinematography, which we'll talk about <a href='#cinematography'>later.</a></p>

	    			<li><b>Art style</b></li>
		    			<p>Hajime Isayama, the author and artist of SnK, had his work <a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34483459' target='_blank'>rejected by many publishers</a> because of his crude art style.</p>

		    			<div class='standard-img'>
		    				<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/81/ea/99/81ea99175aa641baeda8b8fe8b7184cb.jpg" alt="Hajime Isayama's original concept art for (from left to right, descending) Jean Kirstein, Levi Ackerman, Bertholdt Hoover, and Krista Lenz." />
		    			</div>

		    			<p>Several licensers, including Shōnen Jump (whom Isayama had looked up to since he was a kid), deemed his art unfit for the professional scene. Despite almost trashing the story entirely, Isayama made his debut in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessatsu_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Magazine">Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine</a>, spawning what would become one of the most influential gateway anime of all time.</p>

		    			<p>His art style is noted for its scratchy texture. MAPPA Studio, the animation studio that would animate Season 4 and onwards, incorporates much of his linework practices, including extravagant use of sharp lines for shading.</p>

		    			<div class='standard-img'>
		    				<img class='li-1' src="https://ecdn.game4v.com/g4v-content/uploads/2022/02/02135140/game4v-attack-on-titan-ss4-tap-20-2-1643784698-6.png" alt='Eren Yaeger pressuring his father.'>
		    			</div>

		    			<p>However, WIT Studio, who handled the production of seasons 1 to 3, took a bolder approach: having a broader colour palette and using thicker outlines.</p>

		    			<div class='standard-img'>
		    				<img class='li-2' src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/1/12/The_Colossal_Titan_appears_to_breach_the_Wall.png/revision/latest?cb=20180721210006" alt='The Colossal Titan during the Fall of Shiganshina, moments before it kicks open the outer wall gates.'>
		    				<img class='li-2' src="https://preview.redd.it/v6rfy7w75qd21.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=174cbbe95669a1f43cfc43e065776df78d096b90" alt='Eren Yaeger giving off a fiery speech.'>
		    			</div>

		    			<p>Although many would prefer SnK to go without the thick outlines, WIT more than made up for that approach with its stellar animation.</p>
		    		<li><b>Animation</b></li>
		    			<p>The meat of the section: SnK is best known for its fluid and dynamic shots, taking creative liberty without sacrificing its beauty.</p>

		    			<div class='flex-center'>
		    				<video width="560" height="auto" preload="true" controls="true" autoplay="false">
		    					<source src="https://v.redd.it/2oov4cvuohp71/DASH_1080.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		    				</video>
		    			</div>

		    			<p>Most "sakuga" scenes (i.e scenes of noticeably higher quality than usual) are attributed to WIT's tenure. Although MAPPA tends to deliver less "jumpy" aerial sequences, when they deliver, it is as blissful as it was, under WIT's hands.</p>

		    			<div class='relative'>
			    			<div id='spoiler-wrap' class='spoiler-wrap'>
			    				<p>Warning: Heavy Spoilers Ahead!</p>

			    				<div class='break'></div>

			    				<button onClick='spoilerReveal()'>Proceed?</button>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class='spoiler-content flex-center'>

	    					</div>
	    				</div>

	    				<p>Animation Studios with this amount of "sakuga" tend to have bucketloads of freelancers, to spruce up the animation. WIT's greatest hits are often attributed to three animation directors. In particular: <a href='https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=70938' target='_blank'>Arifumi Imai.</a></p>

	    				<p>The sheer tenacity of these hard-working animators, truly is testament to the quality of the animation.</p>
	    		</ul>

    	</div>

    	<div id='cinematography'>
    		<h2>Cinematography</h2>

    		<div>
    			<p>SnK has good composition: particularly with its aerial camera angles and blending of elements.</p>
    			<p>Despite heavy usage of CGI Titans in season 4, MAPPA has blended them well enough to create many decent shots, while keeping up-to-beat with the direction and background art. Still, WIT's camerawork remains unparalleled, with expressive shots here and yonder. From rapid blitzes through the screen to creative entries onto a scene, SnK's cinematography especially flourished under the direction of WIT, although MAPPA's adaptation isn't without its breathtaking sceneries.</p>
    			<p>SnK seems to take great pleasure in "sunny" or bright shots.</p>

    			</div>

    			<p>Complaints regarding the cinematography — around season 4 in particular — stem from its constant blur, which can remove lots of details in the background, and even the foreground.</p>

    			<div class='standard-img'>
    				<img class='li-2' src="https://image.myanimelist.net/ui/5LYzTBVoS196gvYvw3zjwMLCwp9hyUGgC1fPG2XDj6c?_gl=1*1t4i29b*_ga*MTcyMjAwNzc0Ni4xNjQzMzc4MTcw*_ga_26FEP9527K*MTY0NTcyNzY3Mi40LjEuMTY0NTcyNzc0My41Mg.." alt='An Armoured Train, unblurred.'/>

    			</div>

    			<p>Otherwise, SnK has been under diligent hands, and a steady aperture.</p>
    		</div>
    	</div>

    	<div id='music'>
    		<h2>Music</h2>

    		<div>
    			<p>Snk's Original Sound Track (OST) pieces are consistently high-quality. The OST is composed by two people: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Sawano' target='_blank'>Hiroyuki Sawano</a> and <a href='https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=149306' target='_blank'>Kohta Yamamoto</a>; the latter of which was the former's student.</p>
    			<p>SnK's soundtrack leans heavily onto the electronic-orchestral genre, although those two elements aren't always present together at each piece.</p>
    			<p>Sawano's mastery over a composition: his handling of the strings — in partcular: the cellos — guitar strums, dainty or unsettling piano notes, static noise, and impending percussion of doom, is legendary.</p>
    			<p>Yamamoto is not to be outdone: his heavy percussion resounds across chambers, his skillful introduction of so many musical elements without overwhelming, and his sheer, raw power to build hype — is legendary, too.</p>
    			<p>As with any soundtrack, the impact is best felt in the context of the scene, but SnK's music can carry itself just fine.</p>
    		</div>
    	</div>

    	<div id='conclusion'>
    		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

    		<div>
    			<blockquote>
	    			<p>I love Snk, but it is not without its flaws. Still, I hope you'll give it a watch, as in my <i>completely-unbiased</i> opinion, it is totally worth your time.</p>
